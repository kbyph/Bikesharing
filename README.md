# Bike Sharing - NYC Citi Bike with Tableau

## Overview of Project
In order to convince investors to establish a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, we must analyze New York City's Citibike to present visualizations that show  check out times, hourly, and daily bike trips across all users and genders.
- The link to view the full visualizations can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kobe3836

## Resources

- The data here informs us that people have a tendency to rent out a bike for a quick cruise that lasts no more than an hour.
- People are generally going to want to ride a bike for a quick trip, whereas longer bike riders may probably own a personal bike of theirs.

- Although there are more male bikers than females, all riders still checkout around the same times.
- There is no likelihood that shows whether males or females have tendencies to ride longer than one another on average.

- Most bike rides occur either early in the morning, or later in the evening.
- This could be caused by less people being outdoors, therefore leading to less crowded biking paths.

- The data here seems to be very identical throughout each gender category, with similar early and late start times.
- Early mornings and later evenings seem to still be the favorite time of the day for most bikeriders.

- Subscribers make up majority of all riders, riding on the weekdays more frequently than on the weekends.
- Customers do not have a favorable tendency and ride at similar rates althroughout the week.

- Here we see that most bike rides in New York begin around the Manhattan area, possibly due to high tourism rates and cleaner roads.
- Downtown areas see more activity for bikeriders than the neighboring cities across the bridge.

- The ending locations are about the same as where bikeriders initially begin their journeys.
- This could be the fact that these users may be commuting from their homes and back.

## Summary
- Bikesharing in New York has seen great success across the city and would greatly benefits the residents of Des Moines, Iowa. Although males were very prevalent bike riders as shown in the dataset, all genders greatly benefit from this service with similar tendencies throughout the week. Because Des Moines is the capital city, this service would not only provide for the residents, but for the influx of tourists that can also benefit from its convenience.
- An additional visualization that would be very helpful would possibly include bikeriding data across all four seasons, which would help identify usage rates 
throughout the year.
- Another visualization that would help could include the average mileage per rider. This data can be used to adjust cost rates by the second, minute, and hour to determine a rate that all users can agree upon as fair.
